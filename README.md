# nosql-challenge

My name is Sean Weeks, this is my submission repository for the Module 12 Challenge

This repository contains both Jupyter Source Files for NoSQL setup and analysis starter and a Resources folder containing establishments.json, data of various UK food establishments, their locations, address, hygiene rating, etc.
